This is a character creator for the Wrath and Glory role-playing game. I started this project as a way to learn web development. It is written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

Changes I would like to implement:
-A way to save a character build (cookies or something)
-Revamp the list of talents at the bottom of the page, to make it a more user-friendly experience. I could potentially group them by type, such as required keywords
which are not currently being validated)
-Validate talents against keywords (like IMPERIUM, CHAOS, etc.)
